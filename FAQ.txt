Absolutely — a good FAQ section gives your repo that “finished, trustworthy, professional” feel. And for a project like yours, it’s also where you can calmly clear up misconceptions before they even happen.
Here’s a GitHub‑ready FAQ written in the same clean, transparent tone as the rest of your README. You can drop this in as‑is.

## ❓ FAQ
Does this activate Windows or install a product key?
No. This unattend.xml contains no product keys, activation data, or licensing changes. You must activate Windows using your own valid license after installation.

Does this bypass the Microsoft account requirement?
No. This file does not force offline mode or skip Microsoft’s identity flow. You can still sign in with a Microsoft account normally if you choose.

Does this modify the motherboard, firmware, TPM, or hardware identity?
No. Nothing in this file touches firmware, TPM ownership, hardware IDs, or cloud identity. It only automates a few setup steps inside Windows.

Why would someone need this instead of just wiping the drive?
Because wiping the drive doesn’t remove things tied to the board, like cloud identity, Insider enrollment, or provisioning metadata. This file gives the new owner a clean, identity‑neutral baseline without inheriting the previous user’s digital footprint.

Is this safe to redistribute?
Yes. It contains no copyrighted Windows content, no keys, no binaries, and no personal data. It uses only Microsoft‑supported configuration options.

Is this safe to run?
It’s intentionally minimal and transparent, but every system behaves differently.
A small test (VM or spare drive) is recommended before using it on important hardware.
Provided as‑is — use at your own risk.

Does this skip privacy settings or hide important screens?
No. It only hides a few cosmetic OOBE pages (like EULA). Privacy, network, and identity screens remain visible and unchanged.

Can I change the username it creates?
Yes. Edit the  section and replace the username with whatever you want. That’s the only line most users ever need to touch.

Does this remove OEM bloatware?
Indirectly, yes — because a clean install of Windows doesn’t include OEM software.
But the unattend.xml itself does not remove or modify anything.

Does this work on Windows 10?
It’s designed for Windows 11, but the structure is compatible with Windows 10’s setup engine. Behavior may vary slightly depending on edition and build.

Why is this project so minimal?
Because the goal is trust.
No scripts, no hacks, no registry edits, no provisioning packages — just a clean, predictable, identity‑neutral baseline.
