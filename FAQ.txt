# FAQ — Ironeagle-Powers/Unattended.xml

## General Questions

**Q: What is this project for?**  
A: This repository provides a minimal, standards-compliant Windows autounattend.xml for Windows 10/11 installations. It automates only essential configuration while remaining identity-neutral and compliant.

---

**Q: Do I need to be offline for this to work?**  
A: No — the answer file is designed to be online-safe. However, on some Windows 11 builds and editions (especially Home), Microsoft may still enforce Microsoft Account (MSA) sign-in if the device is online. This behavior is determined by the OS and not controlled by the answer file.

---

## Technical Questions

**Q: Will this prevent Microsoft Account prompts every time?**  
A: Where Windows allows a local account path, this file avoids unnecessary MSA enforcement. On certain builds/editions, Windows may still insist on MSA if the device is online; this is a limitation of the OS.

---

**Q: Does this file pre-seed any user accounts?**  
A: No. For identity neutrality and compliance, it does not include usernames, passwords, or pre-seeded accounts. Local account creation is left to the user or deployment tools post-install.

---

**Q: Why not automate local account creation here?**  
A: Pre-seeding credentials in answer files can create security and compliance risks. This project intentionally avoids embedding passwords or user identity to remain transparent and auditable.

---

**Q: Will this skip all OOBE pages?**  
A: It skips non-essential screens (EULA, OEM registration, etc.). Windows may still surface account/credential screens depending on edition and build.

## Deployment and Usage

**Q: How do I use this file?**  
A:  
1. Save this file as `Autounattend.xml`.  
2. Place it at the root of your Windows 10/11 install USB.  
3. Boot the target machine from the USB to begin setup.

---

**Q: Can I use this with WinPE or custom media?**  
A: Yes. It’s compatible with WinPE environments and typical deployment pipelines, including VHD/VHDX boot scenarios.

---

**Q: Is this compatible with MDT/SCCM/Intune?**  
A: Yes — it can be consumed by standard deployment tools that support answer files.

---

## Compliance and Support

**Q: Is this supported by Microsoft?**  
A: The answer file uses only Microsoft-documented settings. However, Microsoft’s official support may vary based on edition, OS build, and online behavior. Unsupported bypasses or registry hacks are not used in this project.

---

**Q: Why doesn’t this use registry keys like LabConfig or BypassNRO?**  
A: Those are unsupported workarounds that can leave the system in a non-compliant state. This project avoids them intentionally.

---

**Q: Are there security risks with answer files?**  
A: Yes — embedding passwords in answer files is risky because these files can remain on the device after setup. This file avoids password injection for that reason.

---

## Comparisons and Alternatives

**Q: How is this different from UnattendedWinstall or Clean-Windows?**  
A: Projects like UnattendedWinstall and Clean-Windows include extensive customizations, PowerShell scripts, registry tweaks, and pre-seeded local accounts. Those tools are powerful, but not minimal, not identity-neutral, and use unsupported methods.

---

**Q: What about answer file generators?**  
A: Generators like schneegans/rbardtke and others can produce minimal, compliant answer files if configured carefully — but they require user choices. This project provides a **pre-built, ready-to-use** file with minimal configuration.

---

## Limitations and Edge Cases

**Q: Does this work on all Windows editions?**  
A: It works where Microsoft’s documented answer file settings are honored. Some Home builds aggressively enforce online account paths, and that behavior may change over time.

---

**Q: Will this continue to work in future updates?**  
A: Microsoft’s OOBE behavior evolves. Users are encouraged to test with new builds as they are released and update configurations accordingly.

---

## Misc

**Q: Why is this project minimal?**  
A: Minimalism improves predictability, reduces side effects, and enhances compliance. It avoids customizations that aren’t part of Microsoft’s documented unattended setup framework.

---

**Q: Can I customize this answer file further?**  
A: Yes — but any additions (local accounts, registry settings, scripts) may change the compliance profile and behavior. Use caution and validate against your deployment requirements.
